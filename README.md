Abstract
Timetable  problem  is  a  NP-hard  problem  where  different constraints and various resources are applied but the resources are  limited.  Optimization  problem  is  a  technique  which  can handle  different  constraints.  This  paper  focuses  the  Bee colony Optimization (BCO) for finding the optimal solutions of  course  time  table.BCO  is  a  Meta  heuristic  optimization scheme  where  NP-hard with  different parameter  settings  are solved. There are two objectives, first  objective  is  to  provide the  introduction  to  timetabling  and  second  objective  is  the BCO and their variations with timetable design. The proposed algorithm  is  used  to  construct
